# Kriyo Framework (`kriyo-fw`)


Kriyo is a local-first framework for building trust-aware apps that work offline, sync peer-to-peer, and execute logic securely — without cloud lock-in or blockchain dependencies.

We believe in building resilient, verifiable systems from the ground up. Our tooling enables capsule-based application development powered by signed data, modular policies, and local runtime evaluation.

> Build apps that think globally — and run locally.
