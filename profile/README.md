# d-verse

**d-verse** is an early-stage framework for building local-first, peer-to-peer applications that don’t rely on cloud platforms, central servers, or blockchain infrastructure.

It’s an exploration into how software can run directly on user devices, sync across trusted peers, and uphold integrity through transparent, decentralized logic — without external control points.

We’re aiming for systems that are:

* **Local-first**: Apps work without an internet connection.
* **Peer-to-peer**: Data flows directly between participants.
* **Trust-aware**: Decisions are verifiable, not opaque or enforced by third parties.
* **Modular**: You can use just what you need, no monoliths.

> ⚠️ This is an evolving idea. We’re still shaping the architecture and approach. If you’re curious about trust-aware systems, local-first software, or alternative networking models — we’d love to talk.
